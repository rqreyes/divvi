# Divvi

Divvi is a bill-splitting application that helps users divide and calculate the tax, tip, and total cost for each person.

## How to Use

### Receipt

Enter items, prices, tax, and tip - subtotal and total will automatically get calculated.

### People

Add names and select the items that belong to each person - individual receipts can be viewed via the dropdown icon.

### Amount Left

If there's a difference, check the items that haven't been selected through the dropdown - in the receipt, items left are denoted with a red underline.

### That's It!

This app is comepletely free. If you'd like to support my journey, please share with your friends and family and/or donate to @rqreyes on Venmo.

Thank you so much :&#41;
